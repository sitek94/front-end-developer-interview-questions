# Front-end developer interview questions

My collection of interview questions for a position of front-end developer with potential answers.
I'm building up this collection as a way to prepare myself for an interview. While looking for a job
I spend first 2hrs checking out job offers and sending applications, then 1hr preparing myself for 
an interview and finally the rest of my day I spend building projects, which is usually 5-6hrs.
