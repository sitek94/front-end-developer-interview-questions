  <summary>What is CDN?</summary>
  
  * Content Delivery Network
  * services that allow us to use libraries, frameworks, etc. without the need to actually attach additional files
    to our project.
  * all we have to do is attach a script from cdn:
  ```javascript
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.6/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
  ```
  * benefits:
    * faster delivery of content - because CDN is a geographically distributed network, if our website is based in the UK and we get traffic from the U.S., itâ€™s possible that your CDN provider has a server in the U.S. and will use that server for your website.
    * more simultaneous users - large number of users can access the network at the same time without delays
    * our project bundles is lighter so we don't clutter the server disk space
  * disadvantages:
    * CDN can fail to
    * we don't know how long the services will be supported
    * restrictions, some countries have blocked the domains or IP addresses of popular CDNs
